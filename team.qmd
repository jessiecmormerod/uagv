**Roman S.**

President, Administration

Hi everyone! My name is Roman and I'm a sophomore. Some of you may know me from our school's band program, others from class or just seeing me around. Some of my favorite things to do include playing drums, piano, flute, baseball, and hockey. I joined this club because I'm deeply concerned about the constant gun violence tragedies that take lives almost every day. Gun violence and drug issues are as significant as COVID, which is why it's important we raise awareness and take action against them.

**Sawyer R.**

Vice President, Gun Laws & Policies Research

Hello! My name is Sawyer, and I'm a sophomore. My main interest is music, I play drums in jazz ensemble, and I marched quads this season. I joined this club because I want to do something to combat gun violence. My mom worked for the Brady Campaign following the Sandy Hook massacre, and was with MGM Resorts when the 2017 Las Vegas Shooting occurred. This gave me an insight into how gun violence affected the population at a young age. I want to use my experience to prevent further shootings and spread awareness.
