**President, Administration**

Roman S.

Hi everyone! My name is Roman and I'm a sophomore. Some of you may know me from our school's band program, others from class or just seeing me around. Some of my favorite things to do include playing drums, piano, flute, baseball, and hockey. I joined this club because I'm deeply concerned about the constant gun violence tragedies that take lives almost every day. Gun violence and drug issues are as significant as COVID, which is why it's important we raise awareness and take action against them.

Hey! My name is Mia, and I am a sophomore at McLean. I sing operatically, and am part of McLean's choral program. I actively participate in Model UN and Mock Trial. I am a part of UAGV because I believe that every student has a right to an education without fearing for their lives.
