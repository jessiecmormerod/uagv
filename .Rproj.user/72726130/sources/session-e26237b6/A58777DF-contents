## Mission of the Club

Our primary objective is to foster a safe and inclusive environment

where students can stand up against gun violence through advocacy, event organization, and

meaningful dialogue. By cultivating empathy, understanding, and a spirit of activism, our club

aims to inspire positive change and advocate for peaceful solutions to address the multifaceted

issue of gun violence. Together, as members of the United Against Gun Violence Club, we strive

to create a safer future for all students andA brief description of the project's mission
