    "text": "Club Sponsor Teacher: Ms. Joy S. Korones\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoman S.\nPresident, Administration\nHi everyone! My name is Roman and I’m a sophomore. Some of you may know me from our school’s band program, others from class or just seeing me around. Some of my favorite things to do include playing drums, piano, flute, baseball, and hockey. I joined this club because I’m deeply concerned about the constant gun violence tragedies that take lives almost every day. Gun violence and drug issues are as significant as COVID, which is why it’s important we raise awareness and take action against them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSawyer R.\nVice President, Gun Laws & Policies Research\nHello! My name is Sawyer, and I’m a sophomore. My main interest is music, I play drums in jazz ensemble, and I marched quads this season. I joined this club because I want to do something to combat gun violence. My mom worked for the Brady Campaign following the Sandy Hook massacre, and was with MGM Resorts when the 2017 Las Vegas Shooting occurred. This gave me an insight into how gun violence affected the population at a young age. I want to use my experience to prevent further shootings and spread awareness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia M.\nDirector, Communications & Program\nHey! My name is Mia, and I am a sophomore at McLean. I sing operatically, and am part of McLean’s choral program. I actively participate in Model UN and Mock Trial. I am a part of UAGV because I believe that every student has a right to an education without fearing for their lives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKareem E.\nDirector, Finance\nHello everyone, my name is Kareem and I am a sophomore. Some things about me, I have a Middle Eastern background from the country of Lebanon. Some of my hobbies include playing soccer, playing the drums, and videogames. I am also part of the McLean high school marching band playing percussion. I am proud to be part of this amazing club that you should consider joining too. I think I speak for a lot of people when I say that gun violence in the U.S. is too high and that there should be awareness of this topic. Do your part and join this club to help the world be a safer place for all of us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXavier R.\nDirector, Partnerships\nGreetings everyone, I’m Xavier, a proud member of the McLean High School marching band, where I play the alto saxophone. I’m also a competitive swimmer for the McLean swim team. I’m honored to participate in this important initiative to raise awareness about gun violence. As part of the student body, I hope to make a positive impact on our school community by adding my voice to this meaningful cause."

    "text": "Striking a Balance Between Rights and Safety in Gun Policy Discussions\n\n\n \n\nThe AR-15, or “ArmaLite Rifle-15,” is a semi-automatic rifle that has become widely popular among gun enthusiasts and firearm owners. While it has legitimate uses such as target shooting and hunting, it is crucial to recognize the potential dangers associated with this weapon. One of the primary concerns surrounding the AR-15 is its firepower and the speed at which it can discharge rounds. The AR-15 is designed to fire rapidly and accurately, allowing for quick succession of shots without the need to manually reload between each shot. This capability can have dire consequences in the wrong hands, as it significantly increases the potential for mass casualties in situations like mass shootings. Another concern is the high-capacity magazines often used with the AR-15. These magazines can hold a large number of rounds, allowing for prolonged firing without interruption. This feature can exacerbate the lethality of the weapon, as shooters can fire off numerous rounds before needing to reload. In situations where law enforcement or civilians are attempting to respond to an active shooter, the extended firing capacity of the AR-15 can make it challenging to neutralize the threat swiftly.\nFurthermore, the ease of customization of the AR-15 raises additional concerns. Accessories such as bump stocks, which allow for rapid firing by harnessing a weapon’s recoil, can transform the already potent firepower of the AR-15 into something even more dangerous. These modifications can be easily obtained and fitted onto the weapon, increasing the potential for rapid and indiscriminate gunfire.\nIt is important to note that discussions about the dangers of the AR-15 should not be mistaken for an attack on responsible gun ownership or the Second Amendment. The focus is on finding a balanced approach that respects individual rights while also ensuring public safety. Implementing measures like comprehensive background checks, waiting periods, and limitations on high-capacity magazines can help address some of the concerns associated with the AR-15.\nIn conclusion, the AR-15 is a firearm with capabilities that, if misused, can pose significant dangers to our communities. While responsible gun owners may use it for legitimate purposes, we must recognize the potential for harm and work towards finding common-sense solutions to mitigate these risks. By engaging in informed and respectful conversations, we can strive to strike a balance between individual rights and public safety, ultimately making our society a safer place for everyone."
