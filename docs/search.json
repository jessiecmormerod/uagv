Some of you may know me from our school’s band program, others from class or just seeing me around. Some of my favorite things to do include playing drums, piano, flute, baseball, and hockey. I joined this club because I’m deeply concerned about the constant gun violence tragedies that take lives almost every day. Gun violence and drug issues are as significant as COVID, which is why it’s important we raise awareness and take action against them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSawyer R.\nVice President, Gun Laws & Policies Research\nHello! My name is Sawyer, and I’m a sophomore. My main interest is music, I play drums in jazz ensemble, and I marched quads this season. I joined this club because I want to do something to combat gun violence. My mom worked for the Brady Campaign following the Sandy Hook massacre, and was with MGM Resorts when the 2017 Las Vegas Shooting occurred. This gave me an insight into how gun violence affected the population at a young age. I want to use my experience to prevent further shootings and spread awareness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia M.\nDirector, Communications & Program\nHey! My name is Mia, and I am a sophomore at McLean. I sing operatically, and am part of McLean’s choral program. I actively participate in Model UN and Mock Trial. I am a part of UAGV because I believe that every student has a right to an education without fearing for their lives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKareem E.\nDirector, Finance\nHello everyone, my name is Kareem and I am a sophomore. Some things about me, I have a Middle Eastern background from the country of Lebanon. Some of my hobbies include playing soccer, playing the drums, and videogames. I am also part of the McLean high school marching band playing percussion. I am proud to be part of this amazing club that you should consider joining too. I think I speak for a lot of people when I say that gun violence in the U.S. is too high and that there should be awareness of this topic. Do your part and join this club to help the world be a safer place for all of us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXavier R.\nDirector, Partnerships\nGreetings everyone, I’m Xavier, a proud member of the McLean High School marching band, where I play the alto saxophone. I’m also a competitive swimmer for the McLean swim team. I’m honored to participate in this important initiative to raise awareness about gun violence. As part of the student body, I hope to make a positive impact on our school community by adding my voice to this meaningful cause."
